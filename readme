 First, ensure you have Jenkins installed and running on your server or local machine.

 In Jenkins, create a new job by selecting "New Item", then choose "Pipeline", and give it a name.

 In the job configuration, under the "Pipeline" section, choose "Pipeline script from SCM". Set the SCM to "Git" and enter the URL of your GitHub repository.

 Provide credentials for Jenkins to access the GitHub repository if it’s private. You can add credentials by using the "Add" button next to the "Credentials" option.

 Specify the branch where your Jenkinsfile is located and the path to the Jenkinsfile within the repository if it’s not in the root directory.

Save your pipeline configuration. Then, build the pipeline by clicking "Build Now".

 View the build output and progress directly in the "Console Output" for the job in Jenkins.
